In no way am I responsible for what anyone does with this program. It is strictly for ethical purposes only.
If you would like to use parts of this program you are absolutely welcome to do so, but you must give credit to the developer (me).

This program took around 4 hours to write. Most time consuming part was the logic and fixing errors.

Run ./hashCracker -h or ./hashCracker --help for usage

The following video explains how the code works and contains personal reflections on the success of the program:
